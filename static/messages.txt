The {cyan-fg}{bold}Sirius Cybernetics Corporation{/} in collaboration with {cyan-fg}{bold}Alessandro Iob{/bold}{/} is proud to announce a new revolutionary artificial intelligence based accounting system.

Our marketing department and engineers have found a way to make your accounting experience more lifelike than ever before using Genuine People Personalities (GPP's).

Your computer will now be able to understand your erratic and unstable emotions because it will have its own preset range of emotions. A few of the personality styles we have to offer are cheerful, gloomy, paranoid, and nurturing. There is a GPP that is ideal for every situation. The integration of emotionally aware systems is proven to improve the fun of the user, their educational experience, comfort level, and ability to improve the user's work-flow.

We are really really excited about this new product! It will revolutionize your work life!!

Enjoy and share!

{magenta-fg}{bold}The Lobby.{/}

You are in the system's lobby and, I must say, it is and incredible technology achievement. The best of the latest UI/UX design patterns have been applied using the renowned Italian "gusto"! A real joy and pleasure for every respectful software engineer. State of the art is and understatement!

From here you can go to the accounting management desk, to the customer registration office or to through the exit. Yes, that slick, frictionless, total black awesomeness is the exit!

Oh yes, there is also a black-on-black Massive Damage's TZ-141 Mark 7 robotic guard! It looks quite impressive as well! Especially when somebody stares at it from the wrong side of its Disrupt-O-Matic Mega-Zap V3 gun. {bold}Not unlikely as you are doing it right now!{/bold}
